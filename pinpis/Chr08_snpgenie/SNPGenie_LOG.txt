This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file. Results at this site are unreliable; G count set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_SM_ES11.vcf	Brast08G093500.v0.1.stacei	5714771	Variant data at this site imply a negative proportion of G nucleotides of -2. This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, G prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
