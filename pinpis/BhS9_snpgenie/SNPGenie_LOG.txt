This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, G prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.

This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, C prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
temp_vcf4_SM_AS25.vcf	NA	20351695	Variant data at this site imply a negative number of A nucleotides: -24. This most often results from variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file.

This may result from rounding error, in which case the number will be very small in magnitude, variants which are assigned to the wrong site in the SNP Report, or multiple copies of the same genes/exons in the GTF file. If the latter, results at this site are unreliable. In either case, T prop has set to 0; proceed with caution.
